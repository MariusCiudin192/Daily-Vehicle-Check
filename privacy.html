            This prototype is intended for demonstration purposes only and does not store submitted data. In a real system,
            the following ethical and privacy considerations would apply:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Personal data such as driver names and vehicle registrations would be stored securely and accessed only
            by authorised personnel.</li>
            <li>Inspection data would be anonymised for evaluation purposes and deleted once analysis is complete.</li>
            <li>Participants taking part in usability testing would be provided with an information sheet and consent form,
            detailing their rights and the purpose of the study.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            For further details, please consult the project's ethics documentation.
