            This portal demonstrates a simple, digital workflow for heavy goods vehicle (HGV) pre‑trip inspections.
            Instead of completing paper checklists, drivers can fill out an online form, attach photos of any defects,
            and submit their inspection digitally. Managers can then review inspections, identify outstanding defects
            and download reports.

            university project and does not store your data.
